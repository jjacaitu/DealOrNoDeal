                <p>There are 20 briefcases in the game board, each one containing a different amount of money ranging from $1 to the <span>highest amount which is $2,000,000.</span> You will have to chose one of the <span>20 briefcases</span> as yours at the start of the game, which you will hold.</p>

                <p><br>In each round you will be asked to open a fixed number of briefcases and the amount inside each of them will be revealed! after that you will recieve a call from the banker, who will make you an offer. You will have 15 seconds to decide if you make a deal with the banker or not! if you make a deal all the remaining briefcases will be opened one by one and finally the amount you had in your briefcase will be known, letting you realize if you made a good deal or not! If you decide to continue playing you will have to pick more briefcases to open and the cycle will continue.</p>
